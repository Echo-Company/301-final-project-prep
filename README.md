## Group Project: Team Agreement

### The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

### Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

## Describe at least:

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Alan: JS experience, 
Armen: Front-end design, bootstrap, JS
Tyler: Design skills, communication, copy-editing
Rob - Communication, CSS. JS

## How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Identify team leads through all stages of the project (Subject Matter Expert) 'remain in the mindset of a preschooler'
Front-end - Armen
CSS, Backend server - Robert
Front-end - Tyler
Front-end - Alan
In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Alan: Front-end, React, documentation, organization
Armen: Wiring quickly in React, speed
Tyler: Everything
Rob: Technical Craft Competency, React and API implementation

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

### Morning Stand Up:

Are there any merges outstanding
Git pull origin main to make sure we’re in the same place
Plan the timeline based on the structure of the project
Meet hourly in the beginning to check in as a group
Check if there are any merges
Merge branches often so we are coordinated and nothing changes too drastically.
Morning Standup
Lunch
End of day
Git pull origin main at the end of the working day
9am - 6 pm PST working day
Take breaks when needed

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

## Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Open communication: Honest, clear, feeling comfortable taking risks to clear the air, no grudges

Timeouts - Walk away when things get heated so they don’t escalate
Grab another member to mediate in the group

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Respectfully draw their attention to the behavior and give them an opportunity to wrap up their thoughts.

Hand off the conversation to another person.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Ask questions
Preschool mindset
Be cool

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Open communication
Be direct with that person

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Consult Audrey

#### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

#### Describe at least

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Alan: Sun-Sat 8:00 a.m. PST - 11:00 pm PST
Armen: Everyday 9:00 a.m. PST - 7:00 p.m. PST
Rob: M-F 8am-8pm, Sat-Sun 8am - 11pm (PST)
Tyler: Sun-Sat 9:00 a.m. PST - 8 p.m. PST

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Tyler: Slack, Phone: 479-599-8229

Rob: Slack, Cell 406-399-0458

Alan: Slack, achelko@gmail.com

Armen: Slack

### How often will you take breaks?

As needed 
At minimum, one hour

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Communication
Utilize TA support
Reach out to Audrey
Focus on the MVP - SIMPLIFY FROM THE START

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack for things that can be handled by anyone in the group when we return to work, or asap

Text: For things that can be responded to within an hour
Call: For immediate emergency communication
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Preschool mindset

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Genuine/natural conversation
Tribe Scary!
Work Plan

### Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

#### NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks

##### Describe at least

###### How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Morning huddle
End of day huddle

### What project management tool will be used?

Slack: for team communication
Google Docs: for planning and file management (Robert is creating this)
Project Management Tool: Trello
Whiteboard tool: Invision
Github: for collateral materials (i.e., pics, etc.)
Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

### Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

Presentation Deck Link

### Schedule your practice session - 

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.

When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.

Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process

### Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

#### Describe at least:

##### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

Organization/Repositories/assets

##### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Anytime we have a working piece of the project, we should seek to merge.

##### What is your Git flow?

Branch on individual branch

Git Pull Origin Main to sync baches

Merge and Pull request when we have working code

Git pull origin main to sync branches

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR? 2

Who merges PRs? Subject matter expert & person who wrote the code (alt. PM)

How often will you merge? Anytime we have working code for a piece of the project

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? - Video chat in Remo.

### Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.
Please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.

Submit a link to your GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.
This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
